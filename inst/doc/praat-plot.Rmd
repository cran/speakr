```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  eval = FALSE
)
library(speakr)
```

With `praat_plot()`, you can create plots of the waveform and spectrogram of a sound file, and add annotation from a TextGrid file.

Start by loading the package if you haven't already.

```{r speakr, eval=FALSE}
library(speakr)
```

## Basic plot

The minimal plot includes a waveform and a spectrogram of a sound file.

```{r basic}
# The sound file.
wav <- system.file("extdata", "vowels.wav", package = "speakr")

praat_plot("vowels.png", wav, end = 3, tg = FALSE)
```

## Plot with TextGrid

You can include annotation from a TextGrid file.
You can specify the path to the TextGrid with the `tg` argument.
If `tg` is set to `NULL` (the default) the function will search for a TextGrid file with the same base name as the wav file, and if it finds one it will add it to the plot.

```{r tg}
praat_plot("vowels-tg.png", wav, end = 3, tg = NULL)
```

## f0 track 

You can add a track of f0 by setting `f0 = TRUE`.

```{r tg-f0}
praat_plot("vowels-tg-f0.png", wav, end = 3, tg = NULL, f0 = TRUE)
```

## Further customisation

Due to the extreme flexibility of the Praat plotting facilities, it is not that straightforward to include all the possible parameters in a single function.

If you would like to customise the plot further, you can run `use_praat_plot_script("plot.praat")` which will copy the Praat plotting script used in `praat_plot()` on disk (in the path you specify in the function), so that you can make any changes to the script and then run it with `praat_run()` as you would with any other Praat script.

## Include plots in Rmarkdown

To include a plot created with `praat_plot()` you can use `knitr::include_graphics("your-plot.png")`.
